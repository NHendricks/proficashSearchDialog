* Export files (see example/*.TXT) via ProfiCash using "Datei - Ausfuehren Export - Umsaetze und Salden - feste Satzlaenge 768" or "Datentransfer - Export ausfuehren - Umsaetze und Salden exportieren - feste Satzlaenge 768".

* Start the tool (you can use the zip in the example folder) with the exported file as parameter and filter account, time, amounts or plain text and get the sum of payments displayed. 
In the tooltip of the calculated sum you see the sum for each year so you can easily check differences.

* You can create an additional file called <file>.criteria and use it to add types of payments.

* For development in Eclipse call gradlew.bat eclipse and import the project.
